According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?

Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.

Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!

            <h2 style = "text-align: left; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 35px;">CHEESE PROPHET?!?!</h2>
            <h4 style = "font-size:20px ;"><i>Call me delphi how my cheese predicts the weather</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <div style = "text-align: left;hyphens: auto; width: 200px;">
As a long time enjoyer of both hard cheeses and rainy days, I saw on a reddit post that cheese can be used to predict oncoming rain! Allegedly, before large thunderstorms, cheese wrapped in plastic will “sweat” and cause beads of water to collect on the cheese and the packaging. Of course, I am not one to spread apochryphal facts so here is what I found:
              <br><br>
Interestingly enough, the initial search of “cheese sweats” references gustatory sweats - a consequence of the protein caesin, which causes the human body to release dopamine upon consumption of cheese and other milk products. Some reports speculate this is an evolutionary incentive for infants to consume their mother’s milk. Cheese also contains amino-acids that, when metabolised, produces phenethylamine, a substance which is commonly compared to amphetamines (yes, like the drug). While this is a fascinating tangent that no doubt explains the cheese-shaped hole in my wallet, it does not yet explain how I can use cheese to predict the weather. <br><br> The answer is not too complicated! When wrapping cold cheese in plastic, humid air will gather and, upon meeting the colder cheese, condense into droplets of water. At a certain temperature, air is capable of holding a certain amout of water vapour before it is considered “saturated” - incapable of holding any more. </div>

 The temperature a body of air must be cooled to become saturated is referred to as the “dewpoint temperature”, which meteorologists use to determine if precipitation will occur. Of course they are usually wrong, but nevertheless, we have our answer. Since air is more humid and saturated with water vapour before significant rainfall, then more vapour will precipitate out when we wrap our cold cheeses. Whether or not this affects the taste of the cheese is unknown, but of no consequence to me, as my favourite cheese, the [[1917 Affine]], is kept wrapped in brown paper and safely stored deep underground in my cheese vaults. It won’t be predicting any rainstorms anytime soon.  <br><br>
