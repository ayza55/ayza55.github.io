People are people are different. How much? Here are some experiences to act as a baseline guess. <br><br>
||Playing music on speaker while washing the dishes, but the phone is too far away and you can’t quite make out the song that is playing, but it is nice nonetheless || Avoiding pieces in D-flat major before realising that Defying Gravity is in D-flat major so maybe it’s an acceptable key after all, despite having far too many flats || Hestitating to eat corn off the cob because while the corn itself tastes amazing, the feeling of having bits of it stuck in your teeth is abysmal || Bus on a rainy day||

Anyone who has taken high-school physics is familiar with the breakthrough of quantised light. That darn theory of energy quantisation generated a lot of hype around the discrete among a lot of very smart people at the time. But it’s not just light that is caught up in the discrete - the modern world is obsessed with categorising everything from tax brackets to actual human personalities - numbers and categories that are so far removed from the actual qualities they are trying to represent. In a world where anything that is remotely important is decidedly Not Discrete, what the hell are we doing?
<br><br>
A lot of quantisation is rooted in safety, and understanding the incomprehensible. There’s a sense of security in introducing yourself as a Capricorn sun with a Virgo moon and Mercury in Aquarius*, where there are standardised presets that are vague and varied enough to inform your personality whilst still feeling unique enough to represent youself as an individual.
 The enneagram test, which places you in a numbered category from 1 to 8 provides the option to “wing”, meaning to partially fit in a second category. One category is already vague enough, and providing a secondary really just gives the user enough leeway to mould whatever result they get to their liking.

The same cannot be said for numbers. Usually, I like numbers, but there is one place that they absolutely do not belong and that is in the description of people and personalities. The same leniancy afforded by worded categories does not scan to numbers - your GPA is your GPA and somehow a measure of general competency. You cannot fight maths, which is usually for the best, until the numbers turn and hit you with a pot of generalisations that boil your soul to an integer number that really really does not represent how much you love minesweeper despite never ranking above 648093 / 4201540 in the beginner’s grid. Numbers or not, I will continue to play minesweeper despite not being very good, and I will continue to do things that have no effect on any numbers out there, like carving lines into my desk and making silly websites and telling people about my favourite musicals. I’m an extrovert like that.**

            <h4 style = "font-size:20px ;"><i>Using cheese to predict the weather</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <div style = "text-align: left;hyphens: auto; width: 200px;">
As a long time enjoyer of both hard cheeses and rainy days, I saw on a reddit post that cheese can be used to predict oncoming rain! Allegedly, before large thunderstorms, cheese wrapped in plastic will “sweat” and cause beads of water to collect on the cheese and the packaging. Of course, I am not one to spread apochryphal facts so here is what I found:
              <br><br>
Interestingly enough, the initial search of “cheese sweats” references gustatory sweats - a consequence of the protein caesin, which causes the human body to release dopamine upon consumption of cheese and other milk products. Some reports speculate this is an evolutionary incentive for infants to consume their mother’s milk. Cheese also contains amino-acids that, when metabolised, produces phenethylamine, a substance which is commonly compared to amphetamines (yes, like the drug). While this is a fascinating tangent that no doubt explains the cheese-shaped hole in my wallet, it does not yet explain how I can use cheese to predict the weather. <br><br> The answer is not too complicated! When wrapping cold cheese in plastic, humid air will gather and, upon meeting the colder cheese, condense into droplets of water. At a certain temperature, air is capable of holding a certain amout of water vapour before it is considered “saturated” - incapable of holding any more. </div>

 The temperature a body of air must be cooled to become saturated is referred to as the “dewpoint temperature”, which meteorologists use to determine if precipitation will occur. Of course they are usually wrong, but nevertheless, we have our answer. Since air is more humid and saturated with water vapour before significant rainfall, then more vapour will precipitate out when we wrap our cold cheeses. Whether or not this affects the taste of the cheese is unknown, but of no consequence to me, as my favourite cheese, the [[1917 Affine]], is kept wrapped in brown paper and safely stored deep underground in my cheese vaults. It won’t be predicting any rainstorms anytime soon.  <br><br>
